# TradeMatch Engine

## Overview
This project implements a **high-performance Order Matching Engine (OME)** designed for **low-latency** execution of limit and market orders. It efficiently handles **high-frequency trading (HFT) scenarios** using advanced data structures and multithreading techniques.

## Features
âœ… **Efficient Order Matching:** Uses max-heaps (buy orders) and min-heaps (sell orders) for optimal execution.  
âœ… **Multithreading Support:** Processes orders in parallel for faster performance.  
âœ… **Low-Latency Design:** Optimized with **lock-free data structures, cache-friendly algorithms, and SIMD acceleration**.  
âœ… **Real-Time Order Simulation:** Continuously generates buy/sell orders to simulate market activity.  
âœ… **Performance Benchmarking:** Includes latency measurement tools to evaluate execution speed.  

## How I Built It
The development of the **High-Performance Order Matching Engine** followed a structured approach:

1. **Project Initialization:**
   - Designed a modular architecture using **C++17**, ensuring scalability and performance.
   - Set up a **CMake build system** for easy compilation and testing.

2. **Order Book Implementation:**
   - Developed an efficient **priority queue-based order book** using **max-heaps** (for buy orders) and **min-heaps** (for sell orders).
   - Implemented an **unordered map** for O(1) lookup, modification, and deletion of orders.

3. **Order Matching Algorithm:**
   - Designed a **matching engine** that continuously processes buy/sell orders with FIFO priority at the same price.
   - Implemented **multithreading** to allow parallel order processing and execution.

4. **Performance Optimization:**
   - Used **lock-free data structures** where applicable to minimize contention.
   - Applied **cache-friendly algorithms** to improve speed.
   - Integrated **benchmarking tools** to analyze execution latency in real-time.

5. **Real-Time Order Simulation:**
   - Created an **order generator** that simulates high-frequency trading (HFT) environments.
   - Ensured the system can handle dynamic order book updates efficiently.

6. **Testing & Debugging:**
   - Implemented rigorous **unit testing** for order insertion, deletion, and matching logic.
   - Debugged concurrency issues and ensured thread safety for multi-threaded execution.

7. **Final Deployment & Documentation:**
   - Packaged the project for deployment with a clean and structured **GitHub repository**.
   - Created this **README** to guide users through installation, usage, and future enhancements.

## Technologies Used
- **C++17** for high-performance computing.
- **Multithreading** for concurrent order processing.
- **Priority Queues (Heaps)** for order book management.
- **Lock-Free Hash Maps** for ultra-fast order lookup.
- **ZeroMQ** (planned) for real-time exchange simulation.

## Build & Run Instructions
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- **GCC/G++ (C++17 or later)**
- **Make (for build automation)**
- **Linux/macOS/Windows (with MinGW or WSL)**

### Compilation Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/High-Performance-Order-Matching-Engine.git
   cd High-Performance-Order-Matching-Engine
   ```
2. Compile the project using Makefile:
   ```bash
   make
   ```
   This will generate the executable `order_matching`.

### Running the Order Matching Engine
After compilation, run the matching engine:
```bash
./order_matching
```
This will continuously generate and match orders in real-time.

### Running Benchmarks
To measure system latency, use the built-in benchmarking tool:
```bash
./benchmarks/latency_test
```
This will output execution time in nanoseconds.

## Future Enhancements
- ðŸš€ **Integration with WebSockets for real-time market data.**
- ðŸ§  **AI-based order execution optimization.**
- âš¡ **FPGA acceleration for ultra-low-latency trading.**
- ðŸ“ˆ **FIX protocol support for real-world trading.**
